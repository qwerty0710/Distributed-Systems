# Distributed-Systems
Following are some of the observations for the load balancer. <br />
# A-1 : Launch 10000 async requests on N = 3 server containers and report the request count handled by each server instance in a bar chart. Explain your observations in the graph and your view on the performance. <br />
# A-2 : increment N from 2 to 6 and launch 10000 requests on each such increment. Report the average load of the servers at each run in a line chart. Explain your observations in the graph and your view on the scalability of the load balancer implementation.
# A-3 : Test all endpoints of the load balancer and show that in case of server failure, the load balancer spawns a new instance quickly to handle the load.
